# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb
puts"Hello World" # = "put" a "s"tring to the screen

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
puts 7

# Perform simple math with numbers
puts 5+3

# Strings
puts "tacos"
#ruby is very forgiving, so much so that you can combine strings and integers! 
puts "tacos"*3
#but this weirdly doesn't work  #puts "tacos"+3

# Combine strings together
puts "#{3+2} tacos" #the #{} allows you to put in calculations, but still turn it into a string

# Variables

# Combine strings and variables

# String manipulation
